# Implementation of Trees in C
Despite the repository being called "binary-tree" the plan is to eventually support multiple tree types including AVL and Heap.
Additionally, it is also planned to support all data types other than integer using a similar structure as the Abstract-Array project on my profile.
There is currently only support for the integer binary tree, offering functions to add and remove values from the tree and use a variety of other functions
to interact with it.

At the moment, tree.c contains all of the function content and make_tree.c tests them by arbitrarily picking random values and calling all of the functions on a tree with those values.
